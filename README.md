# CS50_tshirt
 My custom CS50 shirt

I made my shirt at teespring.com, but there are many vendors online. Mine cost $25 delivered, but it could be less or more depending on the quality of the shirt you select.

I found the font information here: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-font-used-for-Harvards-CS50-shirts

Note the above is from the instructor, David J. Malan.

If you use one of the PNG files, be sure to check "Remove Background". White text and black text included.

I included a link to my class certificate on the back of the shirt. See jpg files in this repository for the results.

Word file included if you want to modify. You can find the fonts online.  Gotham, with “I took” in Light and “CS50” in Bold. I think I substituted ordinary Gotham for Gotham Light.
